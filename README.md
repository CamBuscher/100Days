# 100Days
My 100 days of coding challenge with the design desk!
## Day 1 (January 21)
Not a whole lot, but got my prework site for Turing pushed to github just because, and added some little tweaks to it. Then just got all my stuff together for Turing. Excited to start work in earnest tomorrow! And for the next seven months...
## Day 2 
Started Turing!! A lot a lot a lot of orientation type stuff. Worked some more on our prework websites, which are all very basic, which is fine. One of my favorite things about today is how open Turing is about it's business. The first order of business today was a "State of Turing" presentation where the founder talked about some of the missed goals of 2017 and how they want to improve. 

I was particuarly impressed that three of their cohorts had 100% job-success rates. One reached 100% within 100 days, which is insane. My cohort has 27 people, and the back-end cohort that started today _also_ has 27 people. Each are the largest cohorts yet.
