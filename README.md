# 100Days
My 100 days of coding challenge with the design desk!
## Day 1 (January 21)
Not a whole lot, but got my prework site for Turing pushed to github just because, and added some little tweaks to it. Then just got all my stuff together for Turing. Excited to start work in earnest tomorrow! And for the next seven months...
## Day 2 
Started Turing!! A lot a lot a lot of orientation type stuff. Worked some more on our prework websites, which are all very basic, which is fine. One of my favorite things about today is how open Turing is about it's business. The first order of business today was a "State of Turing" presentation where the founder talked about some of the missed goals of 2017 and how they want to improve. 

I was particuarly impressed that three of their cohorts had 100% job-success rates. One reached 100% within 100 days, which is insane. My cohort has 27 people, and the back-end cohort that started today _also_ has 27 people. Each are the largest cohorts yet.

## Day 3
Whew, I'm tired. Today a little more coding type stuff. All very basic stuff, but I'm going to enjoy that while I can. Quite a bit of work on the command line today, getting people used to working out of that as it can be quite a bit quicker than using the finder system. I also learned a couple of useful command line, well, commands... for lack of a better word. "pbcopy" and "pbpaste" which allow you to copy or paste the _contents_ of a file, and not the file itself (like the "cp" command does.) 

This is cool but the only usecase I see for this is starting a file with a framework of code already in it, i.e. the HTML structure.

Anyway, tomorrow is **picture day** so WHOOOOOOO.

## Day 4
I skipped my picture. Was too busy working on a solo project, which was really basic. We really dove into HTML today, finally. I know it is only day 3 of school but knowing there was a lot of schoolwork on the horizon was daunting and weirdly I'm glad to be in the midst of it now.

The coding itself was very basic so I want to mention the strengths finder test we took. Versions of it are available online for free (google strengths finder test). We got our top five strengths, and mine were:
1. Competition
2. Input (I am a collector of knowledge)
3. Restorative (I strive for perfection in things I guess)
4. Learner 
5. Harmony (I think sequentially and look for practicality in my solutions.)

I'm not sure how I feel about all of those, but it was an interesting exercise and one I guess used by several tech companies (Facebook is he example we were given). They will hire the best available candidate without a job in mind, then have them take the strengths test to help determine where they are best suited to work, and I think that is fascinating.
