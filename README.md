# 100Days
My 100 days of coding challenge with the design desk!
## Day 1 (January 21)
Not a whole lot, but got my prework site for Turing pushed to github just because, and added some little tweaks to it. Then just got all my stuff together for Turing. Excited to start work in earnest tomorrow! And for the next seven months...
## Day 2 
Started Turing!! A lot a lot a lot of orientation type stuff. Worked some more on our prework websites, which are all very basic, which is fine. One of my favorite things about today is how open Turing is about it's business. The first order of business today was a "State of Turing" presentation where the founder talked about some of the missed goals of 2017 and how they want to improve. 

I was particuarly impressed that three of their cohorts had 100% job-success rates. One reached 100% within 100 days, which is insane. My cohort has 27 people, and the back-end cohort that started today _also_ has 27 people. Each are the largest cohorts yet.

## Day 3
Whew, I'm tired. Today a little more coding type stuff. All very basic stuff, but I'm going to enjoy that while I can. Quite a bit of work on the command line today, getting people used to working out of that as it can be quite a bit quicker than using the finder system. I also learned a couple of useful command line, well, commands... for lack of a better word. "pbcopy" and "pbpaste" which allow you to copy or paste the _contents_ of a file, and not the file itself (like the "cp" command does.) 

This is cool but the only usecase I see for this is starting a file with a framework of code already in it, i.e. the HTML structure.

Anyway, tomorrow is **picture day** so WHOOOOOOO.

## Day 4
I skipped my picture. Was too busy working on a solo project, which was really basic. We really dove into HTML today, finally. I know it is only day 3 of school but knowing there was a lot of schoolwork on the horizon was daunting and weirdly I'm glad to be in the midst of it now.

The coding itself was very basic so I want to mention the strengths finder test we took. Versions of it are available online for free (google strengths finder test). We got our top five strengths, and mine were:
1. Competition
2. Input (I am a collector of knowledge)
3. Restorative (I strive for perfection in things I guess)
4. Learner 
5. Harmony (I think sequentially and look for practicality in my solutions.)

I'm not sure how I feel about all of those, but it was an interesting exercise and one I guess used by several tech companies (Facebook is he example we were given). They will hire the best available candidate without a job in mind, then have them take the strengths test to help determine where they are best suited to work, and I think that is fascinating. 

## Day 5

Today we started CSS and Javascript. Javascript I'm most nervous and most excited for, since I have the least experience with it of things we are starting. I can't wait to get a good grasp on that, as I feel like I'm doing okay in terms of CSS and HTML.

We have our first solo projects, this thing called dog party, where we build a website based on this image of a website http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/dog-party.png

I think I got it pretty well under control, but I built it on a 960px width body, and maybe will go back and adjust it all to be on a 100% width body, I'm not sure. It's not due for a few days, so I'll clean up some code in the meantime, but my first attempt is posted a repository on here if you want to check it out and give me some tips on how to clean it up!

We also spent a good portion of our day working with accessibility and particuarly ARIA for screen reader purposes, so I optimized it as well as I could for that, too. It's nice that Turing has a very empathy-driven process, and accessibility is a huge part of that. It's also cool that ARIA form labels seem to make Forms easier than the typical Label+Input pairings. 

Busy day, and I'm up at 11 p.m. which is scary for me now. Hope you're all kicking ass on your challenges!

## Day 6

Fridays at Turing are pretty slow, but we did finish our first javascript lecture, and then got assigned our first real project, this number guesser game based on this comp: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html 

It's interesting to get assigned this before we have actually covered all of the applicable javascript concepts. It's not due until Thursday, but it gives us a chance to give it a go before we actually learn the required information. So I'll start building that today (Day 6, I'm writing this after day 5 because I was pretty wiped last night and forgot) while I go study with some people later. 

We are also continuing our Chrome Dev Tools learning. I feel pretty comfortable with those but it's nice to get a general overview of it all too. 

So that's where I'm at! I'll post my Day 6 update this evening, hopefully with some real progress on the Number Guesser comp.

## Day 7

Today I met with a group of people and we all worked on our own things, but it was nice to be able to help people who needed it as well as get help from others when I did. It's nice to have people to turn to when I'm struggling with a concept. 

I have already found a mentor (somebody who has gone through Turing already) to meet with me when I need some additional assistance, and also a pairing partner in somebody a module ahead of me in Turing. That's rad. 

The only progress I made on the Number Guesser was setting up some HTML and CSS of the project, which I'll finish on Sunday morning. From our study group today I realized I have a firmer grasp on HTML CSS than most at this point, and that is encouraging, but to quote one of the more famous Warcraft wizards: "I must not get complacent."

That's enough nerding for today. Hope you're all doing well! 

## Day 8

Oh man, my life is weird now. I got up at 5:30 a.m. to work on my number guesser project and finish the HTML and CSS of it before delving into the javascript lessons we are doing tomorrow. After that I think I'll have a good grasp on how to attack this project. 

Other than that, a bit of an off day for me, Court and I are going to an animal sanctuary and a movie. We'll see if I regret that come tomorrow night.

## Day 9

I don't really regret my day off yesterday, but kind of regret spending two hours making dinner tonight, as I'm starting the javascript portion of my number guesser now at 8p.m.. But after today's lessons I have a good plan for it.

We learned about eventListeners and querySelectors, which should be able to carry the bulk of the workload on this project. At least on the stuff I can accomplish in the first couple of phases, before making it more complicated later. 

I'm definitely tired for the first time after school. I mean like I could fall asleep right now, but I am excited to knock out this problem! Will report back tomorrow with my progress. 

## Day 10

I got pretty far on my number guesser last night! In a pretty short amount of time. In about three hours I went from no javascript to a solid product (I uploaded the project in a separate repository, check it out! The README has a link to the project). I have finished the first two of four phases, which is enough to pass pretty easily, but I will spend a good amount of time tomorrow having a variable range of numbers to be randomly generated and also able to be manipulated by the user. 

I have a plan of action for it and feel fairly confident in how to accomplish that goal, so I'm excited! 

Anywho, today in school we wrapped up our week of javascript learning, which was enlightening and not too difficult. We also learned how to best utilize Git and Github and that was really fascinating, both in how we can use it now and how it applies for our actual careers. Obviously I have some experience with Github (that's where you're reading this =p), but learning how to use Git locally was new and cool. I learned about branches and how to implement code in a safe way and also recall old snapshots of a codebase if I mess it up! 

So that was all pretty exciting. Tonight I was a bad student and skipped a potential networking event to go play some pub trivia, but I am not that worried about the missed opportunity. There has been about 10 networking events since I started at Turing 9 days ago, and I'm only in week two. But still, looking forward to attending more of those in the future. If I hear of any cool ones I will share it in our facebook group!

## Day 11

Number Guesser completed! I went through all of the important phases and got my project to a level I'm really happy with! I invite you to clone the repository to your system and play with it, it's simple looking but I had a ton of fun making it. 

Not a lot of instruction today, just plenty of work time. We have project evaluations tomorrow and I'm excited/nervous for that, but feel fairly confident.

A big thing I did today was utilize Git in my project. Working out of branches and being liberal with my commits allowed me to make a ton of changes willy-nilly without fear of ruining the whole project. Was very freeing! Excited to have used this project as an excuse to experiment further with that concept. 

## Day 12

Today was another small day as far as instruction goes. The big item on our agenda was our evaluations of our first project, the number guesser, which I have uploaded my newest, final version on github for your perusal. Just clone that repository down and guess some numbers. And tell me any bugs you find! This is likely what I'll show off on Sunday if we all get together.

I think my evaluation went really well, but hopefully I'll have that confirmed in the form of a written evaluation from my instructor soon. 

We did have a lecture on javascript tests and behavior driven development. So far it's a very base level we are working with, but the idea is these repositories of tests are available for us to copy down, and then we have to write out some javascript functions in order for all the specifications of the tests to pass! They are kind of homework that isn't graded but will definitely improve my javascript in the long-term, so I suspect that's what I'll be spending my weekend on if I don't have much in the way of my next project.

## Day 13 

I accidentally skipped this yesterday, but will retroactively update it. We really didn't have a ton of instruction lecture-wise today. Our one lesson was on design!! Which is pretty funny considering my background, but it was mostly a broad overview of well-designed things in the eyes of the class. Some examples were an Aeropress (to some debate), all Apple products (at least from iPod to iPad) and no newspapers :(. 

We went over Dieter Rams 10 design principles, and then read a bit on Swiss design and how everybody loves and uses helvetica. 

We also had an optional mock interview Q&A in the morning that was pretty informative, with some interesting points I noted down, indlucing: being okay saying you don't know an answer to a question, but also showing an interest in the material mentioned and taking notes to reference and read up on it later. The interviewer may know you don't know something, and the fact that you already have an in-person interview means they have an interest in you, so don't ruin it by bullshitting your way through an answer and wasting time.

Again, a pretty light day. We were assigned our first paired project, so starting that this weekend will keep me busy. Tune in tomorrow (today, as I write this) to find out how day one of that went!

## Day 14

We set up the HTML & CSS of our project. It's a website that will take an input of a website name and website URL and on a submit and then create a bookmark for it on the side of the page. An editable list and the items on it can be marked as 'read' or deleted. It's pretty exciting, but a new javascript challenge. 

It also needs to be a responsive webpage which I haven't yet done. I'll have to do some reading up on that to get a good crack at that. But so far so good, we accomplished our weekend goal today, with lots of worktime to go the rest of the week. 

## Day 15

I had a great time talking to my fellow 100 day-ers today about their first two weeks! It's really exciting to be in a group of people of various levels. Me and some others with little experience and others with vastly more, it's pretty fun. 

Other than that hour I also did a bit of reading about modifying the DOM using jquery, and I'm pretty excited to implement the things I learned in my project. I think using "apend" will be really beneficial to adding bookmark items! It's going to be amazing. Excited to start week three of school tomorrow!

## Day 16

Today's lectures were pretty much all javascript focused. We delved into constructor functions which we can use to make multiple instances of similar objects, and a couple of different notation styles for adding properties to those functions. We also delved into javascript testing in our terminal with these challenges called Mythical creatures. 

Essentially you start out with two files, one is blank and it is for your javascript functions, and the other is a javascript test file that you can run in the terminal to test your function as you go. This photo shows me in the middle of one challenge, with my tests on the left in my text editor and my terminal on the right with a test I just ran. https://imgur.com/a/mC8V1

Eventually we will get to the point of writing our own tests for our javascript applications, but this gets us familiar with the format for now. They are kind of way too fun and make me like javascript!

## Day 17

jQuery jQuery jQuery jQuery and some more jQuery. My project this week is coming along well, and is almost entirely written in jQuery. I love it so much more than vanilla javascript, it's simple and not as long-winded and it's powerful.

One thing I want more practice is navigating through jQuery based on parents, siblings, etc. 

For example, this project I am currently working on starts out with just a form on the page, and when the user uses that form they will get a bookmark printed for them on the screen. On that bookmark is a delete button, which needs an event listener to delete the article. However, if you use a vanilla javascript

      document.querySelector(#delete-button).addEventListener('click', function (){
      yada yada yada...}) 

you will get an error that there is no element in the DOM with an ID of delete-button. But with jQuery you can first select the parent element that the new bookmark will live in, then work your way down the tree of elements to the delete button which will eventually exist, and then you don't get errors on page load! So that's fun, but it looks like this, which is a mind-killer: 

    function removeArticle() {
      $(this).closest('article').remove('article');
    }
    $('#list-area').on('click', '.delete-button', removeArticle);

Anywho, current project is in a good spot, and I did some reading (and testing on my own) with breakpoints in CSS, so now it will be more responsive. I could mess with CSS all day, it's extremely rewarding to me. 

Tomorrow we have our mid-mock assessments, where we sit one-on-one with an instructor and they give us some project to build, from scratch, in front of them, for twenty minutes. Basically no rules, googling and looking up MDN sheets for reference is allowed, but they want to see how we think and build things. I'm nervous but hope it will just result in more growth. After all, I'm just here to get better.

## Day 18

We had our mid-mock assessments today ( mentioned them yesterday), but essentially it's a one-on-one with an instructor and they give you a git repository to clone down and a README comp of what to follow. It was basically all javascript, and I think I did well enough on it. I feel like I am at a good level, but I just need to get more reps in to make things more routine. I had to check documentation on a few things, but that's to be expected. 

My partner and I wrapped up our work on our project for the week. It's in a pretty good state, there were some things we didn't quite finish, but all in all I am happy with it! 

As far as actual learning, we went over responsive design in web development, and it's pretty cool! Basically setting breakpoints and different behaviors for those breakpoints so your site or app will look good on all screens. A cool website to demonstrate the four main types of design is http://www.liquidapsive.com/. Just click the drop down menu in the top right of the page and choose different layout types and start resizing your window to see how they each act! 

We also had some work time today, and I tasked myself with reading about and trying out Flexbox. We have a project to design a website's HTML and CSS based on a picture alone, so maybe an additional challenge for me would be building it in Flexbox, although I'm not necessarily sure this site calls for it. A fun website, if you guys are interested in trying it out, is http://flexboxfroggy.com/ ! Very basic introduction to the concepts. Definitely makes spacing things out more intuitive! 

## Day 19

Had my first paired project evaluation today. It went fairly well, I think! Definitely some things I want to improve on, but there's time for that. 

We had a lecture on flexbox, which I mentioned yesterday, and I started work on recreating a static comp, based on this image: http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/static-comp-challenge-1.jpg. Mine is about cows! And how they are rad. I got a good bit done this evening and hope to finish it up tomorrow night! It needs to be responsive and look good on mobile devices without completely ruining the design and style. 

Once I'm done I will post it to github pages and share it here! CSS is so finnicky, but very, very satisfying when I can accomplish something with it.

## Day 20

Slow day today! Lots of commmunity time, but I got to go home early and very nearly finish my static comp I talked about yesterday. Flexbox is super powerful! I would say my favorite thing about it is the ease with which I can align content vertically, a rather challenging aspect of CSS without flexbox. I definitely encourage everybody to check it out for help designing stuff!

Responsive design is fun, but also frustrating. I want to keep things fluid and close to the original design without sacrificing anything, which is nearly impossible. I am excited about my page though, and think it works well in a mobile format as well! I can't wait to share it all with you if I get to see you on Sunday. Still not clear on my schedule, but we start working on our paired project tomorrow morning so I'll know more soon! 

Anyway, not much to talk about today, hope you're all killing it! 

p.s. this is officially my halfway mark for my first module at Turing and that is INSANE to me! It's flying by. 

## Days 21 - 23

Holy moly I'm bad. Full disclosure: It's day 23 and I'm just writing this. Busy weekend, as you can probably surmise. 

**Saturday** - My partner and I knocked out a LOT of our project. We basically have to take some concepts from our last project and apply them to this one, i.e. adding ideas to the page in a card format, except these cards should persist upon refresh and reloading of the browser, meaning we need to utilize local storage. 

Local storage is actually pretty nifty! And not super hard to use. We are kind of getting around one of the main problems in our project, which is storing the cards the user adds as individual objects, and instead we formatted it to store a gigantic string of HTML that changes on pretty much every user input. So it is completely functional (which is the most important part), but it's not ideal. 

I think it will work for the purpose of our project, but over the next few day I want to use the extra time we have earned ourselves to make a side project that does this the correct way with Constructor functions and array prototypes. 

**Sunday** Less code, more life maintenance. Court and I saw a movie and then I spent a few hours working on my javascript testing! Nothing too exciting and no revelations.

**Monday** What a day. Two looooong lectures. One on local storage and one on array prototypes. If you're saying "hey, Cam mentioned that in his Saturday pseudo-entry," you're right! The whole format of Turing is assigning a project that we know essentially nothing about how to approach it, then you struggle all weekend and they give you some answers! Some, but not all. It's actually working super well, I am retaining information at a pretty good percentage (compared to my previous schooling). 

So anyway, array prototypes are kind of really cool! If you're reading this and saying "I have no idea wtf array prototypes are", just remember this: for every asinine thing you are learning right now, know that somewhere you will eventually learn an easier and shorter way to do those things. But you have to struggle with writing arrays yourself and iterating over them with for loops for now. 

This is short, sorry! But I have to get some work done. We're almost a quarter of the way through this challenge, y'all! 

## Day 24

We had a lot of work time today, so I continued my work in my javascript testing, and am at a pretty good point! Nearly done with a week to spare! I started on some of the challenges that require you to write your own tests to test your javascript, which is pretty interesting! According to some further along students testing is a huge part of future modules, so I'm glad I am feeling pretty good with it at the moment.

My partner and I also finished our project, effectively doing everything required of us, but we know we did it in a unique way that may be out of the spirit of the project, as I mentioned in Saturday's entry yesterday. Our instructors were actually cool about it, which I was nervous about. They said it was the first time they'd seen somebody approach it this way, which I think is a good thing? Either way I want to use my extra time to get a good start in my next staic comp and also learn how to do parts of our project in the correct way with storing separate objects in localstorage.

We went over our first static comps as a class today, which I linked in the facebook group yesterday. It was fun to see all the cool and different things people did with same original comp to go off of! 

## Day 25 

1/4 of the way there y'all! 

Today I learned a lot more about ARIA and making my websites more screen-reader friendly. It seems like such a valuable skill but also seems like something that is the first to go for some developers in a time crunch. I would really like to get to a place where it is a strength of mind, because developing with empathy is something I would like to consider a personal asset.

Our instructor, who is very ARIA-savvy, said she has received two job offers just this week to assist companies with their accessibility.

I also got really close to finishing my Javascript testing, just a few more minutes of work tomorrow will put me there! 

As I have mentioned several times, I feel weird about my project's use of local storage, so I went back on my own and recreated the functionality of storing different objects with a constructor function, and then pulling those one by one. It actually wasn't that hard and I was able to have my project fairly functional in about an hour, so that was extremely satisfying! Glad I did, just for myself to know that I can.

Kind of a light day, but only because my partner and I killed it with our project this week, getting it done very early. Evaluation tomorrow, so cross your fingers!

## Day 26

Had my evaluation with my partner today. It went super well, our project was in really good shape, and we met every goal of the project, which was really rad. 

I need to get better at making more commits as I work, because I only had a couple on this repository, so that combined with our working together so much on his computer kind of made me look like a slacker, even though I contributed a large amount, I just didn't make dozens of github commitments. I know nobody thinks I'm lazy or anything, but I don't want to give that impression just because of a work habit I could improve. So for my next project I am going to commit my changes like crazy. Any feature, make a commit. 

I finished my javascript testing today while we had work time, which was really nice to get it out of the way. There's a couple of extra tests I want to try and do before the end of the module just to make it very clear for myself, but I think I have plenty of time for that!

I also knocked out most of my second static comp, which is great because it's not due until Tuesday! I have some friends visiting me for a few days (4 nights, wow!) and I'm totally stressed about it, so I'm trying to put in as much work beforehand as I can. My comp is a monster mash theme with 8 different cards from the old Universal monster movies, and I used a bunch of ugly Halloween colors, so it looks like a middle schooler's mySpace, but on purpose. I hope it goes over well, because hokey is fun. I'll make sure to post another link to it when I have it all finished and published to github pages!

## Day 27

Tired. Week four at Turing is over! I have a crazy hectic week ahead of me, with two projects and friends to host all weekend. My partner is super cool and eased some of my nerves about getting everything done despite my busy week. I hope she's right. 

I don't even think I could do poorly enough in this one week to not make it through this module, I am just nervous about it. 

I hung out with my friends all afternoon and evening, and when they went to sleep I started work on my projects. I completely finished my second static comp, a goofy website called Monster Mash about the Universal monster movies of old. Once I get it up to github pages I will link it here for you all to see, but for now here is a link to the repo with a sneak peek in the README. https://github.com/YayFiber/cb-comp-challenge-2

Going to spend about an hour on my paired project before bed! Trying to be the best student and person all at once but it's exhausting.
