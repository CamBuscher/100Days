# 100Days
My 100 days of coding challenge with the design desk!
## Day 1 (January 21)
Not a whole lot, but got my prework site for Turing pushed to github just because, and added some little tweaks to it. Then just got all my stuff together for Turing. Excited to start work in earnest tomorrow! And for the next seven months...
## Day 2 
Started Turing!! A lot a lot a lot of orientation type stuff. Worked some more on our prework websites, which are all very basic, which is fine. One of my favorite things about today is how open Turing is about it's business. The first order of business today was a "State of Turing" presentation where the founder talked about some of the missed goals of 2017 and how they want to improve. 

I was particuarly impressed that three of their cohorts had 100% job-success rates. One reached 100% within 100 days, which is insane. My cohort has 27 people, and the back-end cohort that started today _also_ has 27 people. Each are the largest cohorts yet.

## Day 3
Whew, I'm tired. Today a little more coding type stuff. All very basic stuff, but I'm going to enjoy that while I can. Quite a bit of work on the command line today, getting people used to working out of that as it can be quite a bit quicker than using the finder system. I also learned a couple of useful command line, well, commands... for lack of a better word. "pbcopy" and "pbpaste" which allow you to copy or paste the _contents_ of a file, and not the file itself (like the "cp" command does.) 

This is cool but the only usecase I see for this is starting a file with a framework of code already in it, i.e. the HTML structure.

Anyway, tomorrow is **picture day** so WHOOOOOOO.

## Day 4
I skipped my picture. Was too busy working on a solo project, which was really basic. We really dove into HTML today, finally. I know it is only day 3 of school but knowing there was a lot of schoolwork on the horizon was daunting and weirdly I'm glad to be in the midst of it now.

The coding itself was very basic so I want to mention the strengths finder test we took. Versions of it are available online for free (google strengths finder test). We got our top five strengths, and mine were:
1. Competition
2. Input (I am a collector of knowledge)
3. Restorative (I strive for perfection in things I guess)
4. Learner 
5. Harmony (I think sequentially and look for practicality in my solutions.)

I'm not sure how I feel about all of those, but it was an interesting exercise and one I guess used by several tech companies (Facebook is he example we were given). They will hire the best available candidate without a job in mind, then have them take the strengths test to help determine where they are best suited to work, and I think that is fascinating. 

## Day 5

Today we started CSS and Javascript. Javascript I'm most nervous and most excited for, since I have the least experience with it of things we are starting. I can't wait to get a good grasp on that, as I feel like I'm doing okay in terms of CSS and HTML.

We have our first solo projects, this thing called dog party, where we build a website based on this image of a website http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/dog-party.png

I think I got it pretty well under control, but I built it on a 960px width body, and maybe will go back and adjust it all to be on a 100% width body, I'm not sure. It's not due for a few days, so I'll clean up some code in the meantime, but my first attempt is posted a repository on here if you want to check it out and give me some tips on how to clean it up!

We also spent a good portion of our day working with accessibility and particuarly ARIA for screen reader purposes, so I optimized it as well as I could for that, too. It's nice that Turing has a very empathy-driven process, and accessibility is a huge part of that. It's also cool that ARIA form labels seem to make Forms easier than the typical Label+Input pairings. 

Busy day, and I'm up at 11 p.m. which is scary for me now. Hope you're all kicking ass on your challenges!

## Day 6

Fridays at Turing are pretty slow, but we did finish our first javascript lecture, and then got assigned our first real project, this number guesser game based on this comp: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html 

It's interesting to get assigned this before we have actually covered all of the applicable javascript concepts. It's not due until Thursday, but it gives us a chance to give it a go before we actually learn the required information. So I'll start building that today (Day 6, I'm writing this after day 5 because I was pretty wiped last night and forgot) while I go study with some people later. 

We are also continuing our Chrome Dev Tools learning. I feel pretty comfortable with those but it's nice to get a general overview of it all too. 

So that's where I'm at! I'll post my Day 6 update this evening, hopefully with some real progress on the Number Guesser comp.

## Day 7

Today I met with a group of people and we all worked on our own things, but it was nice to be able to help people who needed it as well as get help from others when I did. It's nice to have people to turn to when I'm struggling with a concept. 

I have already found a mentor (somebody who has gone through Turing already) to meet with me when I need some additional assistance, and also a pairing partner in somebody a module ahead of me in Turing. That's rad. 

The only progress I made on the Number Guesser was setting up some HTML and CSS of the project, which I'll finish on Sunday morning. From our study group today I realized I have a firmer grasp on HTML CSS than most at this point, and that is encouraging, but to quote one of the more famous Warcraft wizards: "I must not get complacent."

That's enough nerding for today. Hope you're all doing well! 

## Day 8

Oh man, my life is weird now. I got up at 5:30 a.m. to work on my number guesser project and finish the HTML and CSS of it before delving into the javascript lessons we are doing tomorrow. After that I think I'll have a good grasp on how to attack this project. 

Other than that, a bit of an off day for me, Court and I are going to an animal sanctuary and a movie. We'll see if I regret that come tomorrow night.

## Day 9

I don't really regret my day off yesterday, but kind of regret spending two hours making dinner tonight, as I'm starting the javascript portion of my number guesser now at 8p.m.. But after today's lessons I have a good plan for it.

We learned about eventListeners and querySelectors, which should be able to carry the bulk of the workload on this project. At least on the stuff I can accomplish in the first couple of phases, before making it more complicated later. 

I'm definitely tired for the first time after school. I mean like I could fall asleep right now, but I am excited to knock out this problem! Will report back tomorrow with my progress. 

## Day 10

I got pretty far on my number guesser last night! In a pretty short amount of time. In about three hours I went from no javascript to a solid product (I uploaded the project in a separate repository, check it out! The README has a link to the project). I have finished the first two of four phases, which is enough to pass pretty easily, but I will spend a good amount of time tomorrow having a variable range of numbers to be randomly generated and also able to be manipulated by the user. 

I have a plan of action for it and feel fairly confident in how to accomplish that goal, so I'm excited! 

Anywho, today in school we wrapped up our week of javascript learning, which was enlightening and not too difficult. We also learned how to best utilize Git and Github and that was really fascinating, both in how we can use it now and how it applies for our actual careers. Obviously I have some experience with Github (that's where you're reading this =p), but learning how to use Git locally was new and cool. I learned about branches and how to implement code in a safe way and also recall old snapshots of a codebase if I mess it up! 

So that was all pretty exciting. Tonight I was a bad student and skipped a potential networking event to go play some pub trivia, but I am not that worried about the missed opportunity. There has been about 10 networking events since I started at Turing 9 days ago, and I'm only in week two. But still, looking forward to attending more of those in the future. If I hear of any cool ones I will share it in our facebook group!

## Day 11

Number Guesser completed! I went through all of the important phases and got my project to a level I'm really happy with! I invite you to clone the repository to your system and play with it, it's simple looking but I had a ton of fun making it. 

Not a lot of instruction today, just plenty of work time. We have project evaluations tomorrow and I'm excited/nervous for that, but feel fairly confident.

A big thing I did today was utilize Git in my project. Working out of branches and being liberal with my commits allowed me to make a ton of changes willy-nilly without fear of ruining the whole project. Was very freeing! Excited to have used this project as an excuse to experiment further with that concept. 

## Day 12

Today was another small day as far as instruction goes. The big item on our agenda was our evaluations of our first project, the number guesser, which I have uploaded my newest, final version on github for your perusal. Just clone that repository down and guess some numbers. And tell me any bugs you find! This is likely what I'll show off on Sunday if we all get together.

I think my evaluation went really well, but hopefully I'll have that confirmed in the form of a written evaluation from my instructor soon. 

We did have a lecture on javascript tests and behavior driven development. So far it's a very base level we are working with, but the idea is these repositories of tests are available for us to copy down, and then we have to write out some javascript functions in order for all the specifications of the tests to pass! They are kind of homework that isn't graded but will definitely improve my javascript in the long-term, so I suspect that's what I'll be spending my weekend on if I don't have much in the way of my next project.

## Day 13 

I accidentally skipped this yesterday, but will retroactively update it. We really didn't have a ton of instruction lecture-wise today. Our one lesson was on design!! Which is pretty funny considering my background, but it was mostly a broad overview of well-designed things in the eyes of the class. Some examples were an Aeropress (to some debate), all Apple products (at least from iPod to iPad) and no newspapers :(. 

We went over Dieter Rams 10 design principles, and then read a bit on Swiss design and how everybody loves and uses helvetica. 

We also had an optional mock interview Q&A in the morning that was pretty informative, with some interesting points I noted down, indlucing: being okay saying you don't know an answer to a question, but also showing an interest in the material mentioned and taking notes to reference and read up on it later. The interviewer may know you don't know something, and the fact that you already have an in-person interview means they have an interest in you, so don't ruin it by bullshitting your way through an answer and wasting time.

Again, a pretty light day. We were assigned our first paired project, so starting that this weekend will keep me busy. Tune in tomorrow (today, as I write this) to find out how day one of that went!

## Day 14

We set up the HTML & CSS of our project. It's a website that will take an input of a website name and website URL and on a submit and then create a bookmark for it on the side of the page. An editable list and the items on it can be marked as 'read' or deleted. It's pretty exciting, but a new javascript challenge. 

It also needs to be a responsive webpage which I haven't yet done. I'll have to do some reading up on that to get a good crack at that. But so far so good, we accomplished our weekend goal today, with lots of worktime to go the rest of the week. 

## Day 15

I had a great time talking to my fellow 100 day-ers today about their first two weeks! It's really exciting to be in a group of people of various levels. Me and some others with little experience and others with vastly more, it's pretty fun. 

Other than that hour I also did a bit of reading about modifying the DOM using jquery, and I'm pretty excited to implement the things I learned in my project. I think using "apend" will be really beneficial to adding bookmark items! It's going to be amazing. Excited to start week three of school tomorrow!

## Day 16

Today's lectures were pretty much all javascript focused. We delved into constructor functions which we can use to make multiple instances of similar objects, and a couple of different notation styles for adding properties to those functions. We also delved into javascript testing in our terminal with these challenges called Mythical creatures. 

Essentially you start out with two files, one is blank and it is for your javascript functions, and the other is a javascript test file that you can run in the terminal to test your function as you go. This photo shows me in the middle of one challenge, with my tests on the left in my text editor and my terminal on the right with a test I just ran. https://imgur.com/a/mC8V1

Eventually we will get to the point of writing our own tests for our javascript applications, but this gets us familiar with the format for now. They are kind of way too fun and make me like javascript!

## Day 17

jQuery jQuery jQuery jQuery and some more jQuery. My project this week is coming along well, and is almost entirely written in jQuery. I love it so much more than vanilla javascript, it's simple and not as long-winded and it's powerful.

One thing I want more practice is navigating through jQuery based on parents, siblings, etc. 

For example, this project I am currently working on starts out with just a form on the page, and when the user uses that form they will get a bookmark printed for them on the screen. On that bookmark is a delete button, which needs an event listener to delete the article. However, if you use a vanilla javascript

      document.querySelector(#delete-button).addEventListener('click', function (){
      yada yada yada...}) 

you will get an error that there is no element in the DOM with an ID of delete-button. But with jQuery you can first select the parent element that the new bookmark will live in, then work your way down the tree of elements to the delete button which will eventually exist, and then you don't get errors on page load! So that's fun, but it looks like this, which is a mind-killer: 

    function removeArticle() {
      $(this).closest('article').remove('article');
    }
    $('#list-area').on('click', '.delete-button', removeArticle);

Anywho, current project is in a good spot, and I did some reading (and testing on my own) with breakpoints in CSS, so now it will be more responsive. I could mess with CSS all day, it's extremely rewarding to me. 

Tomorrow we have our mid-mock assessments, where we sit one-on-one with an instructor and they give us some project to build, from scratch, in front of them, for twenty minutes. Basically no rules, googling and looking up MDN sheets for reference is allowed, but they want to see how we think and build things. I'm nervous but hope it will just result in more growth. After all, I'm just here to get better.

## Day 18

We had our mid-mock assessments today ( mentioned them yesterday), but essentially it's a one-on-one with an instructor and they give you a git repository to clone down and a README comp of what to follow. It was basically all javascript, and I think I did well enough on it. I feel like I am at a good level, but I just need to get more reps in to make things more routine. I had to check documentation on a few things, but that's to be expected. 

My partner and I wrapped up our work on our project for the week. It's in a pretty good state, there were some things we didn't quite finish, but all in all I am happy with it! 

As far as actual learning, we went over responsive design in web development, and it's pretty cool! Basically setting breakpoints and different behaviors for those breakpoints so your site or app will look good on all screens. A cool website to demonstrate the four main types of design is http://www.liquidapsive.com/. Just click the drop down menu in the top right of the page and choose different layout types and start resizing your window to see how they each act! 

We also had some work time today, and I tasked myself with reading about and trying out Flexbox. We have a project to design a website's HTML and CSS based on a picture alone, so maybe an additional challenge for me would be building it in Flexbox, although I'm not necessarily sure this site calls for it. A fun website, if you guys are interested in trying it out, is http://flexboxfroggy.com/ ! Very basic introduction to the concepts. Definitely makes spacing things out more intuitive! 

## Day 19

Had my first paired project evaluation today. It went fairly well, I think! Definitely some things I want to improve on, but there's time for that. 

We had a lecture on flexbox, which I mentioned yesterday, and I started work on recreating a static comp, based on this image: http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/static-comp-challenge-1.jpg. Mine is about cows! And how they are rad. I got a good bit done this evening and hope to finish it up tomorrow night! It needs to be responsive and look good on mobile devices without completely ruining the design and style. 

Once I'm done I will post it to github pages and share it here! CSS is so finnicky, but very, very satisfying when I can accomplish something with it.

## Day 20

Slow day today! Lots of commmunity time, but I got to go home early and very nearly finish my static comp I talked about yesterday. Flexbox is super powerful! I would say my favorite thing about it is the ease with which I can align content vertically, a rather challenging aspect of CSS without flexbox. I definitely encourage everybody to check it out for help designing stuff!

Responsive design is fun, but also frustrating. I want to keep things fluid and close to the original design without sacrificing anything, which is nearly impossible. I am excited about my page though, and think it works well in a mobile format as well! I can't wait to share it all with you if I get to see you on Sunday. Still not clear on my schedule, but we start working on our paired project tomorrow morning so I'll know more soon! 

Anyway, not much to talk about today, hope you're all killing it! 

p.s. this is officially my halfway mark for my first module at Turing and that is INSANE to me! It's flying by. 

## Days 21 - 23

Holy moly I'm bad. Full disclosure: It's day 23 and I'm just writing this. Busy weekend, as you can probably surmise. 

**Saturday** - My partner and I knocked out a LOT of our project. We basically have to take some concepts from our last project and apply them to this one, i.e. adding ideas to the page in a card format, except these cards should persist upon refresh and reloading of the browser, meaning we need to utilize local storage. 

Local storage is actually pretty nifty! And not super hard to use. We are kind of getting around one of the main problems in our project, which is storing the cards the user adds as individual objects, and instead we formatted it to store a gigantic string of HTML that changes on pretty much every user input. So it is completely functional (which is the most important part), but it's not ideal. 

I think it will work for the purpose of our project, but over the next few day I want to use the extra time we have earned ourselves to make a side project that does this the correct way with Constructor functions and array prototypes. 

**Sunday** Less code, more life maintenance. Court and I saw a movie and then I spent a few hours working on my javascript testing! Nothing too exciting and no revelations.

**Monday** What a day. Two looooong lectures. One on local storage and one on array prototypes. If you're saying "hey, Cam mentioned that in his Saturday pseudo-entry," you're right! The whole format of Turing is assigning a project that we know essentially nothing about how to approach it, then you struggle all weekend and they give you some answers! Some, but not all. It's actually working super well, I am retaining information at a pretty good percentage (compared to my previous schooling). 

So anyway, array prototypes are kind of really cool! If you're reading this and saying "I have no idea wtf array prototypes are", just remember this: for every asinine thing you are learning right now, know that somewhere you will eventually learn an easier and shorter way to do those things. But you have to struggle with writing arrays yourself and iterating over them with for loops for now. 

This is short, sorry! But I have to get some work done. We're almost a quarter of the way through this challenge, y'all! 

## Day 24

We had a lot of work time today, so I continued my work in my javascript testing, and am at a pretty good point! Nearly done with a week to spare! I started on some of the challenges that require you to write your own tests to test your javascript, which is pretty interesting! According to some further along students testing is a huge part of future modules, so I'm glad I am feeling pretty good with it at the moment.

My partner and I also finished our project, effectively doing everything required of us, but we know we did it in a unique way that may be out of the spirit of the project, as I mentioned in Saturday's entry yesterday. Our instructors were actually cool about it, which I was nervous about. They said it was the first time they'd seen somebody approach it this way, which I think is a good thing? Either way I want to use my extra time to get a good start in my next staic comp and also learn how to do parts of our project in the correct way with storing separate objects in localstorage.

We went over our first static comps as a class today, which I linked in the facebook group yesterday. It was fun to see all the cool and different things people did with same original comp to go off of! 

## Day 25 

1/4 of the way there y'all! 

Today I learned a lot more about ARIA and making my websites more screen-reader friendly. It seems like such a valuable skill but also seems like something that is the first to go for some developers in a time crunch. I would really like to get to a place where it is a strength of mind, because developing with empathy is something I would like to consider a personal asset.

Our instructor, who is very ARIA-savvy, said she has received two job offers just this week to assist companies with their accessibility.

I also got really close to finishing my Javascript testing, just a few more minutes of work tomorrow will put me there! 

As I have mentioned several times, I feel weird about my project's use of local storage, so I went back on my own and recreated the functionality of storing different objects with a constructor function, and then pulling those one by one. It actually wasn't that hard and I was able to have my project fairly functional in about an hour, so that was extremely satisfying! Glad I did, just for myself to know that I can.

Kind of a light day, but only because my partner and I killed it with our project this week, getting it done very early. Evaluation tomorrow, so cross your fingers!

## Day 26

Had my evaluation with my partner today. It went super well, our project was in really good shape, and we met every goal of the project, which was really rad. 

I need to get better at making more commits as I work, because I only had a couple on this repository, so that combined with our working together so much on his computer kind of made me look like a slacker, even though I contributed a large amount, I just didn't make dozens of github commitments. I know nobody thinks I'm lazy or anything, but I don't want to give that impression just because of a work habit I could improve. So for my next project I am going to commit my changes like crazy. Any feature, make a commit. 

I finished my javascript testing today while we had work time, which was really nice to get it out of the way. There's a couple of extra tests I want to try and do before the end of the module just to make it very clear for myself, but I think I have plenty of time for that!

I also knocked out most of my second static comp, which is great because it's not due until Tuesday! I have some friends visiting me for a few days (4 nights, wow!) and I'm totally stressed about it, so I'm trying to put in as much work beforehand as I can. My comp is a monster mash theme with 8 different cards from the old Universal monster movies, and I used a bunch of ugly Halloween colors, so it looks like a middle schooler's mySpace, but on purpose. I hope it goes over well, because hokey is fun. I'll make sure to post another link to it when I have it all finished and published to github pages!

## Day 27

Tired. Week four at Turing is over! I have a crazy hectic week ahead of me, with two projects and friends to host all weekend. My partner is super cool and eased some of my nerves about getting everything done despite my busy week. I hope she's right. 

I don't even think I could do poorly enough in this one week to not make it through this module, I am just nervous about it. 

I hung out with my friends all afternoon and evening, and when they went to sleep I started work on my projects. I completely finished my second static comp, a goofy website called Monster Mash about the Universal monster movies of old. Once I get it up to github pages I will link it here for you all to see, but for now here is a link to the repo with a sneak peek in the README. https://github.com/YayFiber/cb-comp-challenge-2

Going to spend about an hour on my paired project before bed! Trying to be the best student and person all at once but it's exhausting.

Here's the github pages link - https://yayfiber.github.io/cb-comp-challenge-2/

## Day 28-29

My last two days have been spent entertaining guests! It's hard to balance work and hosting, but I am going to finally squeeze some more project work in tonight and then meet my partner for a good amount of time tomorrow! 

Sorry for such a short and lame post about coding, the only thing I've really done is prepare for my project by reading about things I need to do. I am really excited to refactor somebody else's code in a way that is different. It's going to be a great way to get real-world experience! Because unless I work at a startup I'm sure I won't be starting from scratch.

Enjoyed a few days of leisure, but I'm now in the nervous stress-work state that helps me thrive later in the week because of the leisure. 

# Days 30-33

Okay I am going to get back into the habit of writing daily. This last week has been an absolute whirlwind. A lot of project time, solo and with my partner, who was really great about working with me despite my annoyingly full schedule.

As I have mentioned before the project this time around was to take some other pair's project from last week and refactor it into something different. It actually went really well for us! I feel confident in my ability to work with javascript in challenging scenarios. We got through a lot of the project with some ease and without needing to ask for help. It seems like a lot of people over complicate javascript out of fear, but you can do a lot with very little code. It probably also helped that our source code wasn't bad in the slightest.

I had a small hiccup yesterday (day 32), with my static comp 2, the monster mash page I shared a couple of posts ago! It looks fine on phones and computer screens, but a couple of very small oversights made it look like absolute garbage on the big televisions we project the projects onto. Basically, don't use viewheight for your sizing unless you specify max and min sizes. I was pretty sad about how awful it reflected on the screen, but know I could fix it in a few minutes if I needed to. I will probably go back and fix it during my week in between modules because it bothers me. Those projects aren't even graded, but man I was bummed about it.

I prepared a short talk on github workflows when working within a team for later today. A fairly easy subject, but a valuable one! If you're reading this and haven't looked into it too much, you should check out the workflow that Turing recommends here: http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/git-team-workflow.html. There's also a lot of great information in those lessons, and they're all available for free, I'm not breaking some kind of weird Turing rule by sharing it. Basically github saves your ass when you break your code by offering you snapshots of your code at different times, but only if you're dilligent about commiting your changes often.

After today my eyes turn towards next week, our pentathlon of challenges, one each day. It will be a whole lot of studying but I am excited to kill it and move on to module two! Hard to believe it's almost here. 

# Day 34

I finished week five at Turing!! Next week is essentially finals week, and I'm feeling really good about it! I'm prepared for all the challenges that are ahead of me (I think), but that won't stop me from overpreparing! 

Today I had another design lesson and a github lesson. I have to say that while I appreciate those lessons, they certainly weren't the strongest learning experiences to go out of a module on. I guess that's on purpose, they probably don't want to drop React on us today or something. 

I also attended a session that discussed the different types of work environments you can find yourself in as a junior dev. I have to say I think I am drawn to a more startup - sized company right now, but I know what is probably best for me long-term is to go somewhere larger where I can have mentors and continue to learn. I don't think those places are bad, I just know a smaller team would be more exciting and fun, but also inherently more risky and challenging. I hope when I graduate Turing that I'm up to the task of whatever I get, because let's be honest, I'm not going to turn down any job. 

I also did some extra javascript testing, and feel REALLY good with those! But I will definitely redo all of them for a little bit sometime this week.

My attention this weekend will be pretty much all studying and (mainly) my third static comp. It's going to be a monster of a build, but I think I can do it! I didn't have the best second static comp (it fell apart on a large television due to a few small oversights), and I'm determined to kick this one's ass, even though it's going to be tough. 

# Day 35

Today I met with some of my cohort and studied for our final week of mod 1! We have a lot of challenges this week, but if I'm being honest I am not super worried about them. I feel confident in my ability traversing the DOM and also in my javascript testing and object creation. My big stressor is my third static comp. The thing is a monster, so I'm just being meticulous with every part of it. I kind of only just started it today, and am proud of what I got done! 

It's not due until Wednesday, and I have all of tomorrow open to work on it, so I hope to be done with its desktop form tomorrow and be well into working on the responsive design too. 

I also met with a friend who went through Turing and taught there, and it was nice just to chat and catch up. Get a break from actually coding and stressing about the week. 

Excited to see you all tomorrow and learn what you've been working on!

# Day 36

Today I met with you all! The wonderful Boulder coding group. There was so much goodness in our group it's hard to pick just one, but with job opportunities opening and new ventures starting, it's all very exciting in our group! So excited for everybody.

Personally I worked all day on my third static comp, and I'm about to finish the base layout of it! Which will leave only responsive design for two whole days, which should be more more more more than enough. I'm really proud of how it looks so far, it feels like a really well planned website, without any fluff in my CSS, which I know can't be true, but I feel happy with it. My house is a total wreck, Courtney is out of town so I brought our kitchen table into the living room and have been using it as a desk with our television as a second monitor, which has actually been amazing. I'm able to do so much with the additional monitor, it's stupid how much time it saves not flipping between programs on my little macbook.

I just took a break from my static comp marathon to work on a couple of DOM manipulation challenges, which is what our test tomorrow is on, and I felt really effin great about them! Somebody recommended we recreate our first challenge in javascript again, and I did that in about 30 minutes! It took me days and days the first time, and I did it in JQuery this time! So only about 30 lines of code for the first two phases of functionality, and super quick! 

I'm about to wrap up my static comp for the evening and call it a damn day, it's been a long one.

# Day 37

Day one of finals week (dubbed the 'pentathlon') is over! I really feel great about how I did on that challenge! Tomorrow is our creature challenge, around making objects with constructor functions and giving them prototype functions to do specific things. It's all in the name of being in a spot to start writing our own tests next mod, which will be exciting and challenging I'm sure.

I'm pretty much done with my third static comp! Just one or two small mobile tweaks and then I will add some ARIA functionality to it so it's nice for screenreaders. Other than that a pretty light day! 

Trying to stay up to get some studying in tonight but I can feel sleep creepin up on me. 

I also figured out how to do a nifty bit of javascript to have this effect on my bar graph for my static comp: https://gyazo.com/5d2305ccec1fa61214bafa555a487d68

I'll post the javascript, but what it is doing is finding the position of your cursor in your window, then when you hover over those bars it's grabbing the text from inside of them (hidden, but there), and adds it to a card which I have follow my cursor around. The card is just hidden on the page before that hover state, but I thought it was pretty rad! 

``` 

$('.progress-fill').on('mousemove', displayTooltip);
$('.progress-fill').on('mouseleave', hideTooltip);

function displayTooltip(e) {
  var x = e.pageX; 
  var y = e.pageY;
  $('.info-card').css('display', 'inline-flex');
  $('.info-card').css('position', 'absolute');
  $('.info-card').css('left', x - 75);
  $('.info-card').css('top', y - 100);
  $('.info-card').children('.card-text').text($(this).find('.tooltip-description').text());
}

function hideTooltip() {
  $('.info-card').css('display', 'none'); 
}

```

# Day 38-40

I haven't logged anything since Monday because I've just been trying to get my pentathlon over with! Tuesday was our javascript testing challenges and yesterday was our evaluation of our third static comp, which I really feel like I rocked. I was stoked with how everything went! 

Today was the defense of our portfolios and when we find out if we go through to module two, and I was so damn nervous. I think I really suffer with imposter syndrome. I did every project and test super well this module and was still immensely nervous about passing the mod. Like just convinced I don't actually belong or something. It's weird and something I'd like to work on.

All that to say that I'm moving on to module two!! I can't explain how excited I am for that, for my week off coming up, and becoming a better developer over all. 

# Days 41-44 

I have thouroughly enjoyed my three days off the last few days, although I'll admit I've been kind of eager to get back to coding. My days of complete rest are probably done for this break, and today I started working on my prework for next module! 

One of our tasks is to refactor a past project, which is actually rad because I wanted to do that anyway to get a more solid grasp on localstorage and storing objects there. So I started doing that tonight, and have actually gotten quite far with that! It's interesting, but I have a feeling localstorage will one day be replaced by something far more powerful, or it already has and I'm just not aware of it. The requirement of storing everything in string form and having to parse and stringify everything is just plain annoying. It adds a lot of bloat to my code and I'm not a fan of that. 

Not much to report on right now, nothing too exciting. I will be delving into Canvas soon and I'm really stoked to get going on that this week! 

# Days 45-47

Slow progress on prework. I was really enjoying my time off, but I think that's all over now, back to the code grind! 

I continued my prework studying by reading about the Canvas element. It's a _huge_ amount of information, but it's really cool and powerful! Basically all the HTML element Canvas does is provide just that, a blank canvas. The rest is javascript. Drawing or importing objects and making them interract with each other or animate. It's really cool, and what I'll be spending the first two weeks of mod 2 on building our games! Should be super fun, but I'm a little intimidated by the scope of it all. 

For the rest of my prework I am doing some reading about ES6 from this book [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read). It seems really cool and I'm excited to start using it more. 

# Day 48

Wow would you look at that: I updated this thing aftero only one day, not three! Miracle! 

Today I finished my ES6 reading. I'm really excited to start working with it, I love me some javascript, and I also read it's the number one in-demand skill of programmers right now, which is exciting because I really enjoy using it. 

ES6 has a lot of cool features, and I'm glad for the brevity in my code the provide. I like the use of classes, default values for parameters, spread operators, and all the different things you can do with arrays. My last bit of prework is reviewing some debugging tools in the console, which I already love and use a lot of (if you aren't using the keyword debugger in your functions that don't work I am sad for you, it's amazing!).

Other than that my laptop is at 4%, so I'm going to end this short ass update. Hope you all are doing super well!

# Day 49

My break week is almost over and I am a little sad, but ready to get back at the same time. There is a lot of cool stuff coming up in mod 2 and I can't wait to start learning it all.

I wrapped up my official prework today, going over some debugging using the developer tools in chrome, most of which was review, but I did learn a couple of neat things! More exciting is what I learned in canvas today. You can make so much in a short amount of time in canvas and it's really exciting to learn all the cool things you can do with it. I followed this four-part tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE. It's really simple and if you have even just a little javascript practice you can make some cool things! I encourage you all to try it out!

# Days 50 - 56 

Whoops! Long ass break of writing these entries! The first week of module two is over and I'm _exhausted_. We learned so much, and so much of it was higher-level concepts of ES6 syntax, array prototypes, object-oriented programming and javascript testing. 

My project was kicked off on Monday afternoon (no lollygagging), and it's a two-week project that's due next Thursday. We are making an old arcade game using HTML canvas. It's insane that some of these games ran on machines that cost thousands of dollars in the past, and some idiot 8-week programming students can struggle through it in about 12 days. 

I am doing brickbreaker with my partner, and it's been a pretty cool experience! Everything on the canvas is essentially just an abstraction of a javascript object, and once you understand that it gets a bit easier to manage in your brain. All of our objects live in different javascript files and interract with one another, which adds an extra level of logic.

I'm loving it all so far, even though my brain feels entirely overwhelmed all the time! I hope to see you all really soon.

## Day 69? 

I think that's what day it is. I just finished my second project and third week of module two. 

Week two my partner and I finished our game!! Here's our repo with some screenshots of the actual game: https://github.com/YayFiber/game-time. It worked well enough and we did well on the project, but man I was tired of that stupid game at the end. 

A couple of big lessons from that project were the focus on testing and object-oriented programming. I'm still not sure if I _like_ OOP, but I enjoy knowing how to utilize it. 

This week was a whirlwind. It's Thursday as I write this, and I just finished a project called Sorting Suite, where we utilized recursive functions to write our own sorting algorithms. If you're asking yourself 'wtf is a sorting algorithm,' fantastic. It's kind of like the method that already exists in a perfected form as *_Array.sort()_*. But we had to write them in javascript from scratch, in three days. 

We recreated bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort, based only on a couple of diagrams, one quick lesson, and several Hungarian dance videos which visualized the sorts -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWBy6J5gz8. 

You can find visualizations of the algorithms online, but they started to get really fun with merge and quick sorts. Here's some diagrams of each, followed by my implementations:

### Merge sort

![Merge sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Merge-Sort-Tutorial.png)

```
const mergeSort = arr => {
  if(arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }
  const divideLine = Math.ceil(arr.length /2);
  let leftArray = (arr.slice(0, divideLine));
  let rightArray = (arr.slice(divideLine));
  
  return sort(mergeSort(leftArray), mergeSort(rightArray));
};

const sort = (leftArr, rightArr) => {
  let newArr = [];
  let i = 0;
  let j = 0;
  while(i < leftArr.length && j < rightArr.length) {
    if(leftArr[i] < rightArr[j]) {
      newArr.push(leftArr[i]);
      i++;
    } else {
      newArr.push(rightArr[j]);
      j++;
    }
  }
  return [...newArr, ...leftArr.slice(i), ...rightArr.slice(j)];
}
```

### Quick sort 

![Quick sort](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Quicksort-diagram.svg/2000px-Quicksort-diagram.svg.png)

```
const quickSort = arr => {
  if(arr.length <= 1) {
    return arr;
  }
  let p = arr.length - 1;
  let i = -1;
  let j = 0;
  while(j < p) {
    if(arr[j] < arr[p]) {
      i++
      [ arr[j], arr[i] ] = [ arr[i], arr[j] ]
    } 
    j++;
  }
  [ arr[i + 1], arr[p] ] = [ arr[p], arr[i+1] ]
  
  let lessThan = arr.slice(0, i+1);
  let greaterThan = arr.slice(i+2)
  return [...quickSort(lessThan), arr[i+1], ...quickSort(greaterThan)]
}
```

And here's the results of all my tests. The speeds of quick and merge sorts are of how quickly the sorted a randomly generated array of 500,000 numbers between 1 and 10,000. Merge sort is quicker and more consistent than quick sort, but the implementation of quick sort is so cool, I kind of prefer it afterall.

Here's a really great video explaining quick sort, it was enough information to base our entire code on. Really should send that guy a cake or something. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZaf_9IZCrc.

Hope you're all doing well, and hope I can get back to more frequent updates.
