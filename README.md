# 100Days
My 100 days of coding challenge with the design desk!
## Day 1 (January 21)
Not a whole lot, but got my prework site for Turing pushed to github just because, and added some little tweaks to it. Then just got all my stuff together for Turing. Excited to start work in earnest tomorrow! And for the next seven months...
## Day 2 
Started Turing!! A lot a lot a lot of orientation type stuff. Worked some more on our prework websites, which are all very basic, which is fine. One of my favorite things about today is how open Turing is about it's business. The first order of business today was a "State of Turing" presentation where the founder talked about some of the missed goals of 2017 and how they want to improve. 

I was particuarly impressed that three of their cohorts had 100% job-success rates. One reached 100% within 100 days, which is insane. My cohort has 27 people, and the back-end cohort that started today _also_ has 27 people. Each are the largest cohorts yet.

## Day 3
Whew, I'm tired. Today a little more coding type stuff. All very basic stuff, but I'm going to enjoy that while I can. Quite a bit of work on the command line today, getting people used to working out of that as it can be quite a bit quicker than using the finder system. I also learned a couple of useful command line, well, commands... for lack of a better word. "pbcopy" and "pbpaste" which allow you to copy or paste the _contents_ of a file, and not the file itself (like the "cp" command does.) 

This is cool but the only usecase I see for this is starting a file with a framework of code already in it, i.e. the HTML structure.

Anyway, tomorrow is **picture day** so WHOOOOOOO.

## Day 4
I skipped my picture. Was too busy working on a solo project, which was really basic. We really dove into HTML today, finally. I know it is only day 3 of school but knowing there was a lot of schoolwork on the horizon was daunting and weirdly I'm glad to be in the midst of it now.

The coding itself was very basic so I want to mention the strengths finder test we took. Versions of it are available online for free (google strengths finder test). We got our top five strengths, and mine were:
1. Competition
2. Input (I am a collector of knowledge)
3. Restorative (I strive for perfection in things I guess)
4. Learner 
5. Harmony (I think sequentially and look for practicality in my solutions.)

I'm not sure how I feel about all of those, but it was an interesting exercise and one I guess used by several tech companies (Facebook is he example we were given). They will hire the best available candidate without a job in mind, then have them take the strengths test to help determine where they are best suited to work, and I think that is fascinating. 

## Day 5

Today we started CSS and Javascript. Javascript I'm most nervous and most excited for, since I have the least experience with it of things we are starting. I can't wait to get a good grasp on that, as I feel like I'm doing okay in terms of CSS and HTML.

We have our first solo projects, this thing called dog party, where we build a website based on this image of a website http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/dog-party.png

I think I got it pretty well under control, but I built it on a 960px width body, and maybe will go back and adjust it all to be on a 100% width body, I'm not sure. It's not due for a few days, so I'll clean up some code in the meantime, but my first attempt is posted a repository on here if you want to check it out and give me some tips on how to clean it up!

We also spent a good portion of our day working with accessibility and particuarly ARIA for screen reader purposes, so I optimized it as well as I could for that, too. It's nice that Turing has a very empathy-driven process, and accessibility is a huge part of that. It's also cool that ARIA form labels seem to make Forms easier than the typical Label+Input pairings. 

Busy day, and I'm up at 11 p.m. which is scary for me now. Hope you're all kicking ass on your challenges!

## Day 6

Fridays at Turing are pretty slow, but we did finish our first javascript lecture, and then got assigned our first real project, this number guesser game based on this comp: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html 

It's interesting to get assigned this before we have actually covered all of the applicable javascript concepts. It's not due until Thursday, but it gives us a chance to give it a go before we actually learn the required information. So I'll start building that today (Day 6, I'm writing this after day 5 because I was pretty wiped last night and forgot) while I go study with some people later. 

We are also continuing our Chrome Dev Tools learning. I feel pretty comfortable with those but it's nice to get a general overview of it all too. 

So that's where I'm at! I'll post my Day 6 update this evening, hopefully with some real progress on the Number Guesser comp.

## Day 7

Today I met with a group of people and we all worked on our own things, but it was nice to be able to help people who needed it as well as get help from others when I did. It's nice to have people to turn to when I'm struggling with a concept. 

I have already found a mentor (somebody who has gone through Turing already) to meet with me when I need some additional assistance, and also a pairing partner in somebody a module ahead of me in Turing. That's rad. 

The only progress I made on the Number Guesser was setting up some HTML and CSS of the project, which I'll finish on Sunday morning. From our study group today I realized I have a firmer grasp on HTML CSS than most at this point, and that is encouraging, but to quote one of the more famous Warcraft wizards: "I must not get complacent."

That's enough nerding for today. Hope you're all doing well! 

## Day 8

Oh man, my life is weird now. I got up at 5:30 a.m. to work on my number guesser project and finish the HTML and CSS of it before delving into the javascript lessons we are doing tomorrow. After that I think I'll have a good grasp on how to attack this project. 

Other than that, a bit of an off day for me, Court and I are going to an animal sanctuary and a movie. We'll see if I regret that come tomorrow night.

## Day 9

I don't really regret my day off yesterday, but kind of regret spending two hours making dinner tonight, as I'm starting the javascript portion of my number guesser now at 8p.m.. But after today's lessons I have a good plan for it.

We learned about eventListeners and querySelectors, which should be able to carry the bulk of the workload on this project. At least on the stuff I can accomplish in the first couple of phases, before making it more complicated later. 

I'm definitely tired for the first time after school. I mean like I could fall asleep right now, but I am excited to knock out this problem! Will report back tomorrow with my progress. 

## Day 10

I got pretty far on my number guesser last night! In a pretty short amount of time. In about three hours I went from no javascript to a solid product (I uploaded the project in a separate repository, check it out! The README has a link to the project). I have finished the first two of four phases, which is enough to pass pretty easily, but I will spend a good amount of time tomorrow having a variable range of numbers to be randomly generated and also able to be manipulated by the user. 

I have a plan of action for it and feel fairly confident in how to accomplish that goal, so I'm excited! 

Anywho, today in school we wrapped up our week of javascript learning, which was enlightening and not too difficult. We also learned how to best utilize Git and Github and that was really fascinating, both in how we can use it now and how it applies for our actual careers. Obviously I have some experience with Github (that's where you're reading this =p), but learning how to use Git locally was new and cool. I learned about branches and how to implement code in a safe way and also recall old snapshots of a codebase if I mess it up! 

So that was all pretty exciting. Tonight I was a bad student and skipped a potential networking event to go play some pub trivia, but I am not that worried about the missed opportunity. There has been about 10 networking events since I started at Turing 9 days ago, and I'm only in week two. But still, looking forward to attending more of those in the future. If I hear of any cool ones I will share it in our facebook group!

## Day 11

Number Guesser completed! I went through all of the important phases and got my project to a level I'm really happy with! I invite you to clone the repository to your system and play with it, it's simple looking but I had a ton of fun making it. 

Not a lot of instruction today, just plenty of work time. We have project evaluations tomorrow and I'm excited/nervous for that, but feel fairly confident.

A big thing I did today was utilize Git in my project. Working out of branches and being liberal with my commits allowed me to make a ton of changes willy-nilly without fear of ruining the whole project. Was very freeing! Excited to have used this project as an excuse to experiment further with that concept. 

## Day 12

Today was another small day as far as instruction goes. The big item on our agenda was our evaluations of our first project, the number guesser, which I have uploaded my newest, final version on github for your perusal. Just clone that repository down and guess some numbers. And tell me any bugs you find! This is likely what I'll show off on Sunday if we all get together.

I think my evaluation went really well, but hopefully I'll have that confirmed in the form of a written evaluation from my instructor soon. 

We did have a lecture on javascript tests and behavior driven development. So far it's a very base level we are working with, but the idea is these repositories of tests are available for us to copy down, and then we have to write out some javascript functions in order for all the specifications of the tests to pass! They are kind of homework that isn't graded but will definitely improve my javascript in the long-term, so I suspect that's what I'll be spending my weekend on if I don't have much in the way of my next project.

## Day 13 

I accidentally skipped this yesterday, but will retroactively update it. We really didn't have a ton of instruction lecture-wise today. Our one lesson was on design!! Which is pretty funny considering my background, but it was mostly a broad overview of well-designed things in the eyes of the class. Some examples were an Aeropress (to some debate), all Apple products (at least from iPod to iPad) and no newspapers :(. 

We went over Dieter Rams 10 design principles, and then read a bit on Swiss design and how everybody loves and uses helvetica. 

We also had an optional mock interview Q&A in the morning that was pretty informative, with some interesting points I noted down, indlucing: being okay saying you don't know an answer to a question, but also showing an interest in the material mentioned and taking notes to reference and read up on it later. The interviewer may know you don't know something, and the fact that you already have an in-person interview means they have an interest in you, so don't ruin it by bullshitting your way through an answer and wasting time.

Again, a pretty light day. We were assigned our first paired project, so starting that this weekend will keep me busy. Tune in tomorrow (today, as I write this) to find out how day one of that went!

## Day 14

We set up the HTML & CSS of our project. It's a website that will take an input of a website name and website URL and on a submit and then create a bookmark for it on the side of the page. An editable list and the items on it can be marked as 'read' or deleted. It's pretty exciting, but a new javascript challenge. 

It also needs to be a responsive webpage which I haven't yet done. I'll have to do some reading up on that to get a good crack at that. But so far so good, we accomplished our weekend goal today, with lots of worktime to go the rest of the week. 

## Day 15

I had a great time talking to my fellow 100 day-ers today about their first two weeks! It's really exciting to be in a group of people of various levels. Me and some others with little experience and others with vastly more, it's pretty fun. 

Other than that hour I also did a bit of reading about modifying the DOM using jquery, and I'm pretty excited to implement the things I learned in my project. I think using "apend" will be really beneficial to adding bookmark items! It's going to be amazing. Excited to start week three of school tomorrow!
