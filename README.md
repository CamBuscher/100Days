# 100Days
My 100 days of coding challenge with the design desk!
## Day 1 (January 21)
Not a whole lot, but got my prework site for Turing pushed to github just because, and added some little tweaks to it. Then just got all my stuff together for Turing. Excited to start work in earnest tomorrow! And for the next seven months...
## Day 2 
Started Turing!! A lot a lot a lot of orientation type stuff. Worked some more on our prework websites, which are all very basic, which is fine. One of my favorite things about today is how open Turing is about it's business. The first order of business today was a "State of Turing" presentation where the founder talked about some of the missed goals of 2017 and how they want to improve. 

I was particuarly impressed that three of their cohorts had 100% job-success rates. One reached 100% within 100 days, which is insane. My cohort has 27 people, and the back-end cohort that started today _also_ has 27 people. Each are the largest cohorts yet.

## Day 3
Whew, I'm tired. Today a little more coding type stuff. All very basic stuff, but I'm going to enjoy that while I can. Quite a bit of work on the command line today, getting people used to working out of that as it can be quite a bit quicker than using the finder system. I also learned a couple of useful command line, well, commands... for lack of a better word. "pbcopy" and "pbpaste" which allow you to copy or paste the _contents_ of a file, and not the file itself (like the "cp" command does.) 

This is cool but the only usecase I see for this is starting a file with a framework of code already in it, i.e. the HTML structure.

Anyway, tomorrow is **picture day** so WHOOOOOOO.

## Day 4
I skipped my picture. Was too busy working on a solo project, which was really basic. We really dove into HTML today, finally. I know it is only day 3 of school but knowing there was a lot of schoolwork on the horizon was daunting and weirdly I'm glad to be in the midst of it now.

The coding itself was very basic so I want to mention the strengths finder test we took. Versions of it are available online for free (google strengths finder test). We got our top five strengths, and mine were:
1. Competition
2. Input (I am a collector of knowledge)
3. Restorative (I strive for perfection in things I guess)
4. Learner 
5. Harmony (I think sequentially and look for practicality in my solutions.)

I'm not sure how I feel about all of those, but it was an interesting exercise and one I guess used by several tech companies (Facebook is he example we were given). They will hire the best available candidate without a job in mind, then have them take the strengths test to help determine where they are best suited to work, and I think that is fascinating. 

## Day 5

Today we started CSS and Javascript. Javascript I'm most nervous and most excited for, since I have the least experience with it of things we are starting. I can't wait to get a good grasp on that, as I feel like I'm doing okay in terms of CSS and HTML.

We have our first solo projects, this thing called dog party, where we build a website based on this image of a website http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/dog-party.png

I think I got it pretty well under control, but I built it on a 960px width body, and maybe will go back and adjust it all to be on a 100% width body, I'm not sure. It's not due for a few days, so I'll clean up some code in the meantime, but my first attempt is posted a repository on here if you want to check it out and give me some tips on how to clean it up!

We also spent a good portion of our day working with accessibility and particuarly ARIA for screen reader purposes, so I optimized it as well as I could for that, too. It's nice that Turing has a very empathy-driven process, and accessibility is a huge part of that. It's also cool that ARIA form labels seem to make Forms easier than the typical Label+Input pairings. 

Busy day, and I'm up at 11 p.m. which is scary for me now. Hope you're all kicking ass on your challenges!

## Day 6

Fridays at Turing are pretty slow, but we did finish our first javascript lecture, and then got assigned our first real project, this number guesser game based on this comp: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html 

It's interesting to get assigned this before we have actually covered all of the applicable javascript concepts. It's not due until Thursday, but it gives us a chance to give it a go before we actually learn the required information. So I'll start building that today (Day 6, I'm writing this after day 5 because I was pretty wiped last night and forgot) while I go study with some people later. 

We are also continuing our Chrome Dev Tools learning. I feel pretty comfortable with those but it's nice to get a general overview of it all too. 

So that's where I'm at! I'll post my Day 6 update this evening, hopefully with some real progress on the Number Guesser comp.

## Day 7

Today I met with a group of people and we all worked on our own things, but it was nice to be able to help people who needed it as well as get help from others when I did. It's nice to have people to turn to when I'm struggling with a concept. 

I have already found a mentor (somebody who has gone through Turing already) to meet with me when I need some additional assistance, and also a pairing partner in somebody a module ahead of me in Turing. That's rad. 

The only progress I made on the Number Guesser was setting up some HTML and CSS of the project, which I'll finish on Sunday morning. From our study group today I realized I have a firmer grasp on HTML CSS than most at this point, and that is encouraging, but to quote one of the more famous Warcraft wizards: "I must not get complacent."

That's enough nerding for today. Hope you're all doing well!
